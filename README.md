# Effective Altruism VR

Welcome to Effective Altruism Virtual Reality!
We're a community for people interested in Effective Altruism who use VR to connect and collaborate.

## What is Effective Altruism?
EA is a community and movement of people who are thinking about how to prioritize our efforts to help others, in order to help others the most - whether this help is through volunteering, donations, or career decisions.

## Why EA VR?
Using the power of VR, people who may be geographically located on opposite sides of the planet can meet in a social VR platform and hang out and converse as if they are physically in the same space together. 

We want to harness this capability in order to massively improve connectivity between people who are interested in effectively helping others and making the world a better place.

If you're curious on how to join our weekly meetups, head to the faq channel! 

Looking forward to seeing y'all! ðŸ’™
